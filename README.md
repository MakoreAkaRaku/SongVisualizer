## Introduction:
Have you heard a song which is a banger but it does not have a video/visualizer good enough?

Me too.. now a days, there's plenty of songs that doesn't have visualizers or visualizers are not good enough for these bangers...

In an effort to try and satisfy myself while learning c++, I created ``SongVisualizer``, which only purpose has to do this job; create a well-deserved visualizer for that song that's always in your mind but you do not like the actual video/visualizer.
