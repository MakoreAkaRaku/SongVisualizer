# SongVisualizer
A c++ based program to create a unique visualizer related to a song.
## Introduction:
Have you heard a song which is a banger but it does not have a video/visualizer good enough?

Me too.. now a days, there's plenty of songs that doesn't have visualizers or visualizers are not good enough for these bangers...

In an effort to try and satisfy myself while learning c++, I created ``SongVisualizer``, which only purpose has to do this job; create a well-deserved visualizer for that song that's always in your mind but you do not like the actual video/visualizer.


## How does it work?
The basis of the whole project is being able to read and understand any audio file (know where frecuency data is stored). To do so, the program must know the structure for each audio format. That's why I've been looking all over internet and writed/described the most important features of each audio format is being supported by the program at this moment.

### WAV Format:
